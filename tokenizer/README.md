Tokenizer Lab

Description
This program divides a string into token depending on the delimiter, in this case the delimiter is set to a space ' ', so if a sentence is entered it will be divided based on the space.
It will check for an empty string in which case the program is set to not allow it and it will end.
Also if the entered string is bigger than 50, it will not be allowed.

Functionality
Once you are on the tokenizer directory
1)Type make
2)Type ./test
Then the program will start 
1)Type a set of characters that follows the previously described rules
2)The vector will be printed
3)The program will keep running unless you press enter with nothing typed

Code Directory
mytoc.h -- file that has declared the methods used in mytoc.c
mytoc.c -- file that has the methods to tokenize
test.h -- file that has declared the metods used in test.c
test.c -- file that receives the input from the user

Collaboration
I talked about the lab in general with Jose Yanez.
